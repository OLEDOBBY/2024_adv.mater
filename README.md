Hello.

We upload trEL datasets which were used as input data of DL predictive model #11-15 (boundaries #1-5 of recombination coefficient).

Each dataset consist of 25,000 trEL profiles.

Each trEL profile has the number of 250 data points and is processed by featurization of logarithm and differentiation.

If you have any question about the datasets or idea to optimize the input datasets for enhancement of the DL model predictability, feel free to contact us anytime via wnstjqq@naver.com email.

Thank you for your visit and attention about this work.
